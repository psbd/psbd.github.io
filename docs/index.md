# The Plan

The plan is to use this documentation to put the technical interivew prepartion materials. We plan to update it at least once everyday. We will be writing the text in the first person view, meaning we will be using the word **We** to present our thoughts. At the same time, we will be using the word **you** to refer the readers of the text. As of now, we are the **you**!

## Getting Started

    for (int i = 0; i < 24; i+=1) {
        int example = 4;
        System.out.print(example);
    }
