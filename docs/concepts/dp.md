    confusions: top-down approach vs bottom-up approach ==> dynamic programming vs memoization

Based on our understanding, Dynamic Programming (DP) problems are the most asked ones in the technical interivews by the top tech companies. 
Thus, we have started our interview preparation journey from the Dynamic Programming concepts. Generally, DP is a concept used for optimization problems (OP). 
Well, what are OPs?: Simply presenting, they are the problems that seek to find either maximum or minimum possible value. For example, given an array of numbers, what is the **maximum** possible length of the increasing subsequences that can be created from it? Example: [1,9, 2, 7, 3, 5]. Out of many possible subsequences (eg. 1, 3, 5), the longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3,5]. If you noticed the last sentence we used **out of many possible...**, meaning the first though process to solving any DP problem is to find all the possible breakdowns of the problem. For the given problem, we are trying to find the longest increasing subseqeuence, thus the starting thought process could be to look at all the possible subsequences. Therefore, alongwith optimization problems, DP can be equally useful for other classes of problems where we need to enumerate the possible solutions and pick the subset from enumerations. 

Well, we think the intro was already too long to get you bored reading this document. So, let's dive into the actual *useful content*. Solving DP problems boils down to two main aspects of the problem. First, finding a **optimal substructure**, and second, finding **overlapping subproblems**. What are these fancy terms? Let's look at them in a little more details in the subsections below:

## Optimal Substructure

To understand optimal substructure, let's first understand substructure. So, let's get out of the jargon of DP: let's say, we want to find the wealthiest person in the world, and also let's say that every city in the world compiles a list of people living in the city and their wealth. So, to find the wealthiest person on the earth, one way could be to collect all these lists of people from every city to create a superlong list of billions of people, and then look for the wealthiest person from the list. The other approach would be to divide the task into several steps (*subproblems*). For example, let's first find the wealthiest person in every city. Then, at country level, let's compile a list of all these city-based weltiest persons, and then find the wealthies person in every country. Then, let's compile another list of these country-level wealthiest people at the world-level, and find the wealthiest person in the world! Well, this example is not a DP problem, but we hope you get some idea on substructure. There are two key concepts in these substructures.

    1. The problem has to be broken down into levels
    2. The problem defintion at every level should remain the same!!! (the most important theory!)

Now coming back to the optimal substructure, the idea here is to extend the concept of *same problem definition* at every level. So, (generally, an optimization) problem is said to have an optimal substructure property if it can be broken down into subproblems and the final solution of the problem can be derived from the solution of these subproblems (also note that: these subproblems could derive their solutions from their own subproblems, and so on!). In our example above, the worldwide problem was solved by solving the *same problem* (finding the wealthiest) for countries, and the *same problem* for a country was solved by solving the *same problem* for cities in the country. Thus, it exibits the optimal substructure property. 

## Overlapping subproblems

Looking at our example above, one thing we can say is that  the optimal substructure is not only true for DP problems (how could finding the wealthiest person in the world be a Dynamic Programming problem!). What makes these problems with the optimal substructures, closer to the DP problems, is their characterstic of *Overlapping subproblem*. So, what exactly is it? For this, let's extend the above problem of finding the wealthiest person in the world with one unrealistic assumption. Let's say, there are many cities in the world that belong to multiple countries (which is not possible in this divided world, but in our idle world, let's say this is true!). For example, let's say there are three countries ***A, B, and C***. Country A has cities x,**y**, and z; B has cities **y**,p,q; and C has cities **x**,**q**,r,s!  Also, let's present the above solution from a different perspective (people call it top-down approach, which we will discuss in more details later!). So, let's say, country A first finds its wealthiest person. For this, it asks its cities x,**y**, and z to do the same. The cities look at their list and find their wealthiest person and report to the country. Now country B does the same asking its cities **y**,p,q. The cities look at their lists and find their wealthies person. City **y**, although it calculated its wealthiest person already for country A, it does the same process of looking throught the same list again for country B. Similarly, **x**, and **q** of country C again repeat the process that they already did for their other countries A, and B respectively. I think you are seeing some pattern here, same subproblem (city) has repeated for multiple countries. So, instead of calculating the wealthiest person for a new country again, these cities could be used their previous calculations that they did for the other country. This is the main power of DP problems. So, the main idea of overlapping subproblem is as follows:

    1. Same lower subproblem appears in multiple subproblems.
